 # Nota -- For Making Sense of your Kindle Highlights

 Nota is a tool to help you make sense of your Kindle highlights. It parses your `My Clippings.txt` file and organizes your highlights by book, making it easy to review and study them.

 This project provides both a command line interface (CLI) and a desktop app powered by a shared core parser library.
